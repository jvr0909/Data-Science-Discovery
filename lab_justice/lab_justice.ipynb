    "We plan on continuing to explore simulation in Python this week, however, this time, we are going to simulate some real-world events that have actually happened in the past.  The goal is for you to see how we can use data science to think about issues of equity and social justice.  As usual, in addition to coding, we want you to get practice having discussions about the data science you are doing and think about how data science can be a useful tool that can help you in your future job and as a citizen.\n",

    "The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides the right to an “impartial jury” in criminal prosecutions, but what exactly does this mean? The Supreme Court has said that juries must be drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. In other words, juries should be randomly selected from the eligible population. However, there are many instances in history where it doesn’t seem like this was the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example, the case of Berghuis v. Smith.  In 1993, Smith (a black man) was convicted of second-degree murder by an all-white jury and sentenced to life in prison. The jury was selected from a panel of about 100 randomly selected people. Only 3 of them were Black and none of those three made it into the final 37 considered for Smith’s trial. The county population was approximately 8 percent Black at the time of the trial.  Remember, jury panels are supposed to be selected at random from the eligible population.\n",

Critics and Smith claimed that the system of jury selection caused the lack of fair and reasonable representation of black people on the jury.\n",

Remember, from the case: we are trying to see if the difference between 8% and 3% is small and reflects no attempt to include or exclude a specified number of African Americans.\"  In other words, **we want to write a function to randomly sample 100 people from a population that has 8% Black people.**  The function should return the number of Black people in each jury.  We can do this multiple times and see how rare it is to get 3 or fewer people in the jury."

The resumes that they sent were identical, except they changed the names and email addresses to have either a “white sounding” name like Emily or a “black sounding” name like Lakisha, according to the study.  Assuming that a resume has about a 20% chance of getting a call back and half of the resumes had white sounding names and half had black sounding names, let’s do this simulation.  We will simulate the results and then look at what actually happened.\n",

Some of the companies claimed this difference was due to chance.  Do you think this is a significant difference? Why do you think this happened? Why or why not is this problematic?\n",

Since the content of the resumes are identical, we should expect to get an equal number of call backs for both types of names.  In other words, picking the callbacks should be like random sampling.  Next, we wrote a simulation to randomly sample 20% of 500 resumes 10,000 times.  Half of the 500 resumes are represented as 0s (representing white sounding names) and half of the resumes are represented as 1s (representing black sounding names).   "
